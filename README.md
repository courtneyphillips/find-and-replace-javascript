#Find and Replace

---

## Synopsis

Find & Replace is a simple Ruby application built by [Courtney Phillips](https://github.com/courtneymaepdx) with the ability to seek out a given word within a provided phrase, and replace each occurrence of that word with another. Crafted as part of the Spring 2015 JavaScript course curriculum at [Epicodus](https://www.epicodus.com/).

## Motivation

The Hair Find & Replace app was created as an exercise in seamlessly integrating JavaScript logic, jQuery functionality, and HTML & CSS aesthetics into one fluid, easy-to-use application.
